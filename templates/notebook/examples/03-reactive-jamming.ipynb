    "# Reactive Jamming\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we continue our jamming experiments with the goal to attack only specific devices or message types. In LoRaWAN, this can be easily implemented, since most of the relevant fields are not encrypted. That allows reading a frame symbol by symbol until enough data is gathered decide whether the frame should be jammed or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "From an attacker's perspective, this technique facilitates hiding jamming activity, as the actions are very specific. From a security researchers perspective, using reactive jamming allows to limit attacks only to research devices, making experimentation easier without affecting operational networks. That is particularly important for LoRaWAN, since the great range prevents realistic experiments within a single, shielded lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to test the effectiveness of such a **reactive jammer**:\n",
    "- by offset of the data used for decision within the frame\n",
    "- by data rate\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background: Reactive Jamming\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how the reactive jammer works in LoRaWAN, let's have a look at the frame structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "0    1                   5     6                                                              Offset\n",

    "|MHDR|      DevAddr      |FCtrl|FOpts|   FCnt  |Port|      Payload      |        MIC        | Content\n",
    "+----+----+----+----+----+-----+ - - +----+----+----+ - - - - - - - - - +----+----+----+----+\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The information about the message type is stored in the `MHDR` field directly at the beginning of the frame. The device address follows directly after. That means, the relevant information for most use cases is stored within the first five bytes of each frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "A LoRaWAN data frame has at least a length of 12 byte (no payload, meaning also no `Port`, and also no `FOpts`). An example of such a frame would be an ACK or the answer to an ADRAckReq. That leaves us with 12-5=7 byte of decision margin after the device address is transmitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point it is important to note that there is no 1:1 correlation between payload bytes and symbol boundaries because of the spreading-factor-dependent bit/symbol ratio and the forward error correction. However, we will see that the 7 byte margin is always enough to jam LoRaWAN data frames."

    "\n",
    "A third node is the `jammer`. The jammer works most successful if it is close to the receiver (`bob` in this case), so that the SNR for a frame sent by the jammer is 6dB higher at `bob`, compared to `alice`'s valid frames.\n",

    "For more information on node configuration and troubleshooting, see the `01-tx-test` notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later on, we will also add a node called `sniffer` that is close to node `alice`, which will try to receive the original frame, while it is jammed for the legitimate receiver. This again works due to the capture effect and the physical distance between nodes. While the reactive jamming experiments can be done in a single room, for jamming plus sniffing, a physical distance creating an attenuation of more than 6dB is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole topology looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "   ,---------,                                     ,---------,\n",

    "   `---------´         attenuation >6 dB           `---------´\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`alice` and `sniffer`, as well as `bob` and `jammer` can be connected to the same ChirpOTLE hosts. We use ChirpOTLE nodes for all of the devices, since that facilitates experimentation. Alice and bob can be replaced by a LoRaWAN end device and gateway, respectively."

    "In this section, we try to receive the original content of jammed frames, while still jamming them for the legitimate receiver. This lays the foundation for wormhole attacks, as mentioned in [section 5 of our paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3395351.3399423). As the figures there already show, the attacker needs two nodes for this to work, one located as close as possible to the transmitter, and one close to the legitimate receiver. The node at the transmitter acts as sniffer, and the node at the receiver as jammer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The success of this attack depends on the characteristics of the capture effect in LoRa: If the receiver has synchronized to a LoRa frame, it will succeed in demodulating it, if no interference of a non-orthogonal chirp arrives at the receiver with a higher signal level than -6 dB compared to the synchronized frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our setup, we attach the sniffer board to node alice and require an attenuation of 6 dB to the node to which bob and the jammer are attached to. Usually, several office walls are sufficient for this, in urban outdoor environments, it might require up to some hundreds of meters.\n",

Due to the jammer, the Network Server has not processed the frame yet, meaning a frame with that frame counter value is still valid.\n",

If such devices do not contain their own clock or the payload does not contain a timestamp to reduce the frame length, the time of sensor readings often is assumed to be close to the transmission time. If an attacker can sniff frames, they can start replaying these frames later, and thus adding wrong temporal information to the sensor readings. The effect depends on the type of sensor.\n",

If LoRaWAN geolocation is used, frames can be replayed at totally different locations to simulate movement of the devices.
